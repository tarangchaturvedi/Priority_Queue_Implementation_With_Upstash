## Introduction

This project is a Queue Service enhancement assignment focusing on:
1. Implementing a priority queue in an existing codebase.
2. Developing a new queue using Upstash as the backend thorugh Redis.

The project includes priority-based request handling, adherence to First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) within the same priority level, and comprehensive test cases for validation.

---

## Features

- **Priority Queue System**: Requests are assigned numerical priorities for efficient retrieval.
- **InMemoryPriorityQueue**: Enhanced to support priority-based polling and FCFS order.
- **Upstash-Based Queue**: Uses Redis via Upstash HTTP API, with the same priority system.
- **Test Cases**: Comprehensive tests for functionality and edge cases.

## Execution Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tarangchaturvedi/Priority_Queue_Implementation_With_Upstash.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Priority_Queue_Implementation_With_Upstash
   ```
3. Run UnitTests:
   ```bash
   run tests from the command-line with mvn package
   ```

## Test Cases

### InMemoryPriorityQueue
- Validates priority-based polling.
- Ensures FCFS order within the same priority.
- Covers edge cases such as empty queues and duplicate priorities.

### Upstash-Based Queue
- Tests priority-based ordering via Upstash.
- Validates FCFS behavior for requests with identical priorities.
- Handles API errors and retries.

Run tests using:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
