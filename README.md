## Introduction

This project is a Queue Service enhancement assignment focusing on:
1. Implementing a priority queue in an existing codebase.
2. Developing a new queue using Upstash as the backend thorugh Redis.

The project includes priority-based request handling, adherence to First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) within the same priority level, and comprehensive test cases for validation.

---

## Features

- **Priority Queue System**: Requests are assigned numerical priorities for efficient retrieval.
- **InMemoryPriorityQueue**: Enhanced to support priority-based polling and FCFS order.
- **Upstash-Based Queue**: Uses Redis via Upstash HTTP API, with the same priority system.
- **Test Cases**: Comprehensive tests for functionality and edge cases.
